# Drug-classifier/predictor-using-naive-bayes-classification-algorithm
This project is developed in an end to end manner,it helps to predict drug based upon certain inputs given by the patient , it basically gives recommendation of the drug according to their body's health

The main motivation of using naive bayes classifier for this project is because our prediction is based upon mutli class classification / multi categorical values such that naive bayes is one of the best ways to predict multi categorical features i had implemented in this project 

kindly follow the instruction which has been provided in the demo video in order to attain better execution of this project

Before execution save the HTML file (Drugpredict.html) in a folder named as "templates" on the same directory where the rest of the codes are saved..
